**3D Surface Perception**
How the brain represents 3D surfaces and directs attention to surfaces is not well known. We propose a neural model that is able to reproduce previous psychophysical results related to attention and surfaces.

**3D Visual Saliency**
We extend a previous model of proto-object based saliency to include depth information. Our results show that the added depth information provides a small, but statistically significant improvement in gaze prediction on three separate eye tracking datasets.

Code | Paper

**Contour Integration**
We propose a recurrent neural network that is able to perform contour integration and border ownership assignment using the same set of parameters. Our model reproduces several sets of experimental results, while providing testable predictions.

**Head Movements in Virtual Reality**
Covert attention is traditionally studied using eye movements under head-fixed conditions. Here, we leverage recent advances in consumer-grade virtual reality technology (Google Cardboard) to study the role of head movements when viewing natural images in virtual reality. Our work begins by quantifying head movement kinematics under these conditions, with possible extension to understanding head movements as a proxe for visual attention.

**Contour Detection/Figure-Ground Segmentation**
Figure-ground segmentation has been shown to occur for simple artificial images, but whether these mechanisms are robust in natural images and the exact neural circuitry responsible are not clear. Here, we propose a image computable model that is able to perform both contour detection and figure-ground segmentation on natural images. We use the Berkeley Segmentation Dataset (BSDS) to evaluate our results.
