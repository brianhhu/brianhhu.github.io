**Bayesian Object Recognition**

Integrate information across receptive fields and fixation locations.

**Head Movements in Virtual Reality**

Covert visual attention is traditionally studied using eye movements under head-fixed conditions. Here, we study the role of head movements when viewing large-scale, immersive natural images in virtual reality. We quantify head movement kinematics under these conditions, which provides a foundation for understanding how head movements may be correlated with other measures of visual attention, including eye movements and interest points.

**Contour Detection/Figure-Ground Segmentation**

Figure-ground segmentation has been shown to occur for simple artificial images, but whether these mechanisms are robust in natural images and the exact neural circuitry responsible are not clear. Here, we propose a image computable model that is able to perform both contour detection and figure-ground segmentation on natural images. We use the Berkeley Segmentation Dataset (BSDS) to evaluate our results.

**Contour Integration and Border Ownership**
<img style="float: right;" src="http://brianhhu.github.io/img/Fig_Contour.eps" width="100">

We propose a recurrent neural model that is able to perform both contour integration and border ownership assignment using the same set of network parameters. A key feature of our model is the use of grouping neurons whose activity represents tentative objects based on the integration of local feature information. Our model reproduces several sets of experimental results, while providing testable predictions.

**3D Visual Saliency**

We extend a previous model of proto-object based saliency to include depth information. Our results show that the added depth information provides a small, but statistically significant improvement in gaze prediction on three separate eye tracking datasets. Our results are consistent with a proto-object based framework for perceptual organization.

**3D Surface Representation**
<img style="float: right;" src="http://brianhhu.github.io/img/Fig_3DSurface.png" width="500">

How the brain represents 3D surfaces and directs attention to these surfaces is not well known. We propose a neural model that is able to group together disparity-selective neurons that belong to a surface. Our model reproduces several psychophysical results related to the spread of attention across surfaces.
