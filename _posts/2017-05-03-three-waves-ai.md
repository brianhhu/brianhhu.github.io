title: The Three Waves of A.I.

In this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-O01G3tSYpU), John Launchbury of DARPA talks about the three waves of A.I., or artificial intelligence. I found the video helpful in putting the field of A.I. in historical context, while also providing a roadmap for the future of A.I.

The three waves are:

1. **Handcrafted Knowledge**  
Building in logical reasoning through implementation of a set of rules. This allows for reasoning over narrowly defined problems, but has no learning capability and poor handling of uncertainty.  

   *Examples*: chess-playing programs, TurboTax  
   *Challenges*: early self-driving cars
  
2. **Statistical Learning**  
Good at perceiving and learning about the natural world, but has minimal abstraction or reasoning abilities. Can perform nuanced classification and prediction, but has no contextual capability.  

   *Examples*: neural nets, deep learning, many diverse real-world applications  
   *Challenges*: adversarial examples, requires vast amounts of training data

3. **Contextual Adaptation**  
Building explanatory models over time that can characterize real-world phenomena. When interrogated, these models allow us to understand how the model makes decisions. Learning is used to create a contextual model, perception is interpreted in terms of this model, which can then drive reasoning and abstraction.  

   *Examples*: one-shot learning, generative models for handwriting  
   *Challenges*: requires combining the first two waves, still in early stages
  
  Most of my research has focused on handcrafted knowledge, essentially the art of finding useful features that can explain perceptual phenomena based on first principles. I'm starting to delve more into statistical learning, mainly understanding why deep learning and convolutional neural networks work so well on a variety of different problems. I also firmly believe that we will need contextual models, as they are a step closer to the way that we as humans learn and reason. What do you think about these three waves? Will the current hype about deep learning die down or is it here to stay?
