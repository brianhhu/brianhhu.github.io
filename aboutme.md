I'm a graduate student at Johns Hopkins University pursuing a PhD in [biomedical engineering](http://www.bme.jhu.edu/), with a focus on [computational neuroscience](http://www.bme.jhu.edu/research/neuroscience-neuroengineering). I work with Ernst Niebur in the [Computational Neuroscience Laboratory](http://cnslab.mb.jhu.edu/). My research is on neural mechanisms for structuring low-level feature information into objects, in the context of surface perception, visual saliency, contour detection, and figure-ground segmentation. I am interested in the intersection of computer vision, computational neuroscience, and deep learning, particularly why humans see so well while computers, despite the immense computational resources they have access to, still continue to "see" so poorly.
