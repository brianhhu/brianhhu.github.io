I'm a graduate student at Johns Hopkins University pursuing a PhD in [biomedical engineering](http://www.bme.jhu.edu/), with a focus on systems neuroscience and neuroengineering. I work with [Ernst Niebur](http://www.neuroscience.jhu.edu/research/faculty/62) and [Rudiger von der Heydt](http://neuroscience.jhu.edu/research/faculty/89) in the Solomon H. Snyder Department of Neuroscience. My [research](https://brianhhu.github.io/research/) is on modeling the neural mechanisms of perceptual organization and selective attention. I'm also interested in the intersection of biological vision and computer vision, and how fundamental principles from computational neuroscience can help us to build machines that see. You can contact me [here](mailto:brian.hsiaochuan.hu@gmail.com).
