I'm currently a computer vision researcher at [Kitware, Inc.](https://www.kitware.com/computer-vision/) Previously, I was a research scientist at the [Allen Institute for Brain Science](https://www.alleninstitute.org/what-we-do/brain-science/). I did my graduate studies at Johns Hopkins University where I worked with [Ernst Niebur](http://www.neuroscience.jhu.edu/research/faculty/62) and [Rudiger von der Heydt](http://neuroscience.jhu.edu/research/faculty/89). My [research](https://brianhhu.github.io/research/) bridges both neuroscience and machine learning. I'm interested in the intersection of biological vision and computer vision, and how fundamental principles from computational neuroscience can help us to build machines that see.
