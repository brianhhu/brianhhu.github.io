I'm a graduate student at Johns Hopkins University pursuing a PhD in [biomedical engineering](http://www.bme.jhu.edu/), with a focus on systems neuroscience and neuroengineering. I work with [Ernst Niebur](http://www.neuroscience.jhu.edu/research/faculty/62) and [Rudiger von der Heydt](http://neuroscience.jhu.edu/research/faculty/89) in the Zanvyl Krieger Mind/Brain Institute. My [research](https://brianhhu.github.io/research/) is on the neural mechanisms of perceptual organization, with applications to surface representation, visual saliency, contour detection, and figure-ground segmentation. I am interested in the intersection of biological vision and computer vision, and particularly why humans see so well compared to computers. You can contact me [here](mailto:brian.hsiaochuan.hu@gmail.com).
